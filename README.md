## Overview
ASOS Clothes Clone is a full-stack project that aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for online shopping. This project is inspired by the ASOS online store and attempts to replicate its functionality and design.

## Features

1. User Authentication and Authorization: Implemented user authentication mechanisms such as sign-up/sign-in using hashing (bcrypt) and JWTs. Users can create an account, log in and manage their profiles. Used authorization to manage user roles and permissions to control access to certain features or content. 

2. Product Management: Created a robust system for managing products, including adding new products, updating existing ones, and removing discontinued items. Products are displayed with images, names, descriptions and prices. Implemented categorization and tagging systems to organize products into logical groups. Users can click on a product to view more details. 

3. Shopping Cart: Developed functionality for users to add products to their shopping cart and proceed to checkout seamlessly. Users can update the quantity of a product or remove it from their shopping cart and dynamically view the total price before going to checkout. 

4. Search and Filtering: Implemented search functionality allowing users to find products based on various criteria such as category, size, color, brand and price range. Provided filtering options to refine search results for a more personalized shopping experience. Users can search for specific items and filter results based on these categories.
